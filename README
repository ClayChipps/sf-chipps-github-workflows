# Github Workflows

Reusable workflows and actions

## Opinionated Publish Process for npm

1. use conventional commits to work on a feature branch
2. merge to main
3. A push to main produces a tagged Github Release via `githubRelease`
4. The release should cause `npmPublish` to run.

Just need to publish to npm? Use a public action!
Use this repo's publish if you need one of the following features

1. codesigning for Salesforce CLIs
2. integration with CTC
   or if you own other repos that need those features and just want consistency.

### npmPublish

example usage

```yml
on:
  release:
    # the result of the githubRelease workflow
    types: [published]

jobs:
  my-publish:
    uses: salesforcecli/github-workflows/.github/workflows/npmPublish.yml
    with:
      tag: latest
      githubTag: ${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}
    secrets:
      NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN}}
```
